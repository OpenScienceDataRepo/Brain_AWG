# FASTQ -> FASTQC -> HISAT2 -> Count Matrices

## 1. FASTQ -> FASTQC

The FASTQ files for this dataset were downloaded from [this directory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA747152). They were then converted to Count Matrices using the [FastQC package](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).

To install the FastQC Package, I used the following code:
```
# changing directory to where my installation is
cd /Volumes/Marians\ SSD

# unzipping and moving the installation
unzip fastqc_v0.12.1.zip
mv FastQC ~/FastQC
cd ~/FastQC

# make fastqc executable
chmod 755 fastqc

# testing fastqc (if it launches, then it's ready to go)
./fastqc

# make FastQC available globally (using symlink)
sudo ln -s /Users/mariannavarro/FastQC/fastqc /usr/local/bin/fastqc

# test
fastqc --help
```

Once that was set up, I ran fastqc on the PRJNA747152 FastQ files using the following code:
```
fastqc /Volumes/Marians\ SSD/ADBR\ Mito/PRJNA747152/FASTQ/* -o /Volumes/Marians\ SSD/ADBR\ Mito/PRJNA747152
```

## 2. FASTQC -> HISAT2

I moved the resulting FastQC files to a folder called "FastQC".
