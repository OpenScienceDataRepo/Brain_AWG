# Procedure

## QC and DESeq2

The raw counts were not available. When I reviewed the original paper, however, I found that Supplementary Table 1-5 contained DEGs for the following conditions:
- 0.4Gy LDR + 10Gy irradiated vs. unirradiated larval male brains
- 0.4Gy LDR + 10Gy vs. 10Gy irradiated larval male brains
- 0.4Gy LDR + 10Gy vs. 0.4Gy LDR irradiated larval male brains
- 10Gy irradiated vs. unirradiated larval male brains
- 10Gy vs. 0.4Gy LDR irradiated larval male brains

This meant that the QC and DESeq2 was already completed by the original researchers, making the data ready for the rest of the workflow.
