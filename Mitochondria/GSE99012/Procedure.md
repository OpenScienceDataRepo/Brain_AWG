# Procedure

## QC and DESeq2

The raw counts were not available. When I reviewed the original paper, however, I found the following supplementary file:

*Table S1. Differentially expressed genes identified from different comparisons under FDR ≤ 0.05 and absolute log2 fold change ≥ 1.2. (XLSX 1236 kb)*

This meant that the QC and DESeq2 was already completed by the original researchers, making the data ready for the rest of the workflow.

*Sekiya M, Wang M, Fujisaki N, Sakakibara Y, Quan X, Ehrlich ME, De Jager PL, Bennett DA, Schadt EE, Gandy S, Ando K, Zhang B, Iijima KM.
