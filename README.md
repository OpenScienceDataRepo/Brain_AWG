# Brain Analysis Working Group (AWG)

**OSDR AWGs Overview**  
The [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://www.nasa.gov/osdr/) is a science collaboration initiative that provides an open-access data system designed to help scientists discover and access space-relevant datasets to perform primary, secondary, and meta-analyses. OSDR has established the [Analysis Working Groups (AWGs)](https://www.nasa.gov/osdr-open-science-analysis-working-groups/) with the goal of optimizing the metadata, data, and features available to maximize the gain of new knowledge from such rare and complex datasets. The AWGs will assess and improve the effectiveness of the OSDR through intensive utilization of OSDR resources and generate higher-order data. This GitHub repository is dedicated for Brain AWG members to share and collaborate their work and codes.

**Brain AWG Overview**  
The Brain AWG is comprised of researchers, students, principal investigators, physicians, and subject matter experts working together with a shared goal of identifying commonalities between the effects of spaceflight and known brain-related diseases to develop methods and countermeasures to facilitate resilience against such diseases during spaceflight. Brain AWG members meet regularly to share and discuss the latest developments in space biology related to brain research, and form sub-groups that focus on specific diseases and phenomena associated with spaceflight.
